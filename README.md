## Compute Tangents SOP

Houdini plug-in bringing [mikktspace] library written by Morten S. Mikkelsen.
Computed tangents can be used to bake normal maps. Resulting normal maps will
be synced with xNormal, Blender, 3D Coat, Unreal Engine 4, Unity and other
software using this library, and may not be synced with Houdini native tangents
well.

### Houdini 16 Note
Since Houdini 16.0.514, MikkTSpace supported at render-time via
[`vm_bake_usemikkt`](http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/props/mantra#vm_bake_usemikkt)
property. Try it at first, if you don't need Mikk's tangents in SOP level as
geometry attributes.


### Installation
See [Releases] for Windows binaries. To compile on Windows with Visual Studio
or Build Tools, [update] `HDK_*` macros inside `.props` file with your Houdini
version and build `.sln` file. To compile on other operation systems, follow
[tutorial] on HDK building and use source code files directly.
